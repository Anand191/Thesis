\subsection{Neural Machine Translation with Attention}
It was shown by \cite{W14-4012} that the performance of a basic encoder-decoder models as explained in \ref{theory:nmt} is inversely related to the increase in length of the input sentence.

\section{Formal Language Theory}
The field of formal language theory (FLT) concerns itself with the syntactic structure of natural language without much emphasis on the semantics. More precisely a formal language $L$ is a sequence of strings with the constituent units/words/morphemes taken from a finite vocabulary $\Sigma$. It is more apt to define the concept of a formal grammar before proceeding further. A formal grammar $G$ is a quadruple $<\Sigma, NT, S, R>$ where $\Sigma$ is the vocabulary as previously defined, $NT$ is the set of non-terminals, $S$ the start symbol and $R$ the set of rules. A rule can be expressed as $a \rightarrow b$ and can be understood as a substitution of $a$ with $b$ with $a, b$ coming from $\Sigma$ and/or $NT$. Now a formal language $L(G)$ can be defined as the set of all strings  \textit{generated} by grammar $G$ such that the string consists of morphemes only from $\Sigma$, and has been generated by a finite set of rule ($R$) application after starting from $S$.

\subsection{Subregular Hierarchy}\label{flt:sh}
The simplest class of languages encountered in section \ref{flt:ch} were regular languages that can be described using a FSA. If a language can be described by a mechanism even simpler than the FSA then it is a subregular language. While far from the expressive capabilities of regular languages which in turn are the least expressive class in the Chomsky hierarchy, subregular languages provide an excellent benchmark to test a compositional system.
