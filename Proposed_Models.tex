\chapter{Proposed Models}\label{Chapter:proposals}

The biggest criticism of deep learning is its overt dependence on voluminous data. For human level concept learning and generalization, deep learning models need to become more data efficient. I would like to break down the task of compositionality into two parallel sub-tasks as follows:
\subparagraph{Storing Information meaningfully and efficiently}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A more efficient data representation.
	\item The new RNN cell designed with efficient memory allocation considerations.
	\item Information Compression.		
\end{enumerate}
\subparagraph{Retrieving Information efficiently}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Attentive Guidance	
	\item Pondering
	\item Curriculum Learning (Understander Executor).
\end{enumerate}
