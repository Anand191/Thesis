\section{Conclusions}
Hard AG works
learning AG is hard
Focus should be on developing methods to learn the trace better.



\section{Future Work}
Understander executor
Representation learning
Latent space

I would like to break down the task of compositionality into two parallel sub-tasks as follows:

\subparagraph{Storing Information meaningfully and efficiently}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A more efficient data representation.
	\item The new RNN cell designed with efficient memory allocation considerations.
	\item Information Compression.		
\end{enumerate}
\subparagraph{Retrieving Information efficiently}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Attentive Guidance	
	\item Pondering
	\item Curriculum Learning (Understander Executor).
\end{enumerate}
