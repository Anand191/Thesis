\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Set up to solve lookup tables tasks with attentive guidance
	\item briefly revisit the trace used
	\item Set up to show how symbol rewriting was solved with attention guidance
	\item explain the trace used
	\item How AG in seq2seq directly translates to pondering?
	\item Why looking only at Seq Accuracy in LT and Symbol rewriting acc in SR.
\end{itemize}

While in the case of look up tables we can just look at the final target we choose to view the entire sequence because that show compositional solution.

\section{Lookup Tables} \label{exp:sr}

\subsection{AG Trace}
As explained in section \ref{pm:ag-ponder} attentive guidance can help in mocking the pondering. The biggest difference from the Pondering in section \ref{mtv:ponder} would be that at each pondering step we have an emission, instead of the ponder step being a silent one. The trace for the attentive guidance can be explained as follows and is shown in figure \ref{ag_lt}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first step is the copy step where the three bit input to the composition is copies as if.
	\item After this the tables in the composition are applied sequentially to the three bit input preceding them.
	\item The diagonal trace is mean to capture this sequential and compositional solution of lookup tables. At each step of decoding we force the model to focus on only that input prompt which results in the correct output for that step.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Accuracy}
Since the lookup tables can be viewed as nested functions, accuracy of final output of the composition can be an adequate measure of model performance. However since we want to ensure that the model doesn't learn spurious patterns in data to land at an un-compositional solution, we want it to be accurate at each step of the composition. This hierarchical measure of accuracy is a viable test for the compositionality of the network. Therefore in all evaluations \textit{sequence accuracy} is the performance metric of the model.
