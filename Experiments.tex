\begin{itemize}
	\item Set up to solve lookup tables tasks with attentive guidance
	\item briefly revisit the trace used
	\item Set up to show how symbol rewriting was solved with attention guidance
	\item explain the trace used
	\item Set up to solve MicroTasks with baseline. Baseline solved decision problem but not search.
	\item Trace for MicroTasks
	\item Trace for SCAN.
	\item How AG in seq2seq directly translates to pondering?
\end{itemize}
